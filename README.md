# README - Groundwork Statics

---------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to provide a starting point for webapps. While
we do install Ruby, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, this is primarily geared towards
static web apps (Ruby is there in case you want to use sass/compass, node is
there to install bower, yeoman, etc). Apache is installed as well so you just
need to go to http://10.10.10.10 (the directory for that application would
go into application/html).

For installation/getting started, read INSTALL.md.
